        <h2>Effect on natural resoures </h2>
        <p>Temperature Regulation:
            Greenhouse gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, creating a natural greenhouse effect. This process is essential for maintaining a habitable temperature on Earth. Without this effect, the planet would be too cold for many forms of life.<br>
            
            <li> <b>Climate Patterns: </b></li>
            Changes in the concentration of greenhouse gases can affect climate patterns. An increase in these gases, often attributed to human activities like burning fossil fuels and deforestation, enhances the greenhouse effect and contributes to global warming. This, in turn, leads to shifts in climate patterns, including more frequent and severe weather events.<br>
            
            <li> <b> Sea Level Rise:</b></li>
            The warming of the Earth's surface causes thermal expansion of seawater and the melting of glaciers and polar ice caps. This results in rising sea levels, impacting coastal ecosystems and communities.<br>
            
           <li> <b> Ocean Acidification:</b></li> 
            Greenhouse gas emissions not only affect the atmosphere but also contribute to increased CO2 levels in the oceans. This leads to ocean acidification, which can have detrimental effects on marine life, particularly organisms that rely on calcium carbonate for their shells and skeletons.<br>
            
            <li> <b>Weather Extremes: </b></li>
            The increase in greenhouse gas concentrations is associated with more frequent and intense heatwaves, storms, and other extreme weather events. These changes can disrupt ecosystems, impact agriculture, and pose risks to human communities.<br>
